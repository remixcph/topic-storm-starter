# Topic Storm Starter

Welcome to Remix Copenhagen. 


In this repo you'll find all you need to get started on your (maybe) first Remix application.


## The App you'll build


Topic Storm: an app used to brain brain storm new topics for meetups. 

**Main features are**

- Users can sign-up and login
- Users can see topics suggested by other users
- Users can vote on topics
- Users can comment on topics
- users can assign themselves to topics


The app looks like this:

## Getting Started

To build this app you'll need to go through several small tasks. 

We'll provide you with a base repository which already contains
- Signup and login
- Main components 
- Prisma schema and a remote database connection (yes, the database is live!)


Your aim is to add the missing features which should touch on the most relevant points of Remix.


Let's get into it!
